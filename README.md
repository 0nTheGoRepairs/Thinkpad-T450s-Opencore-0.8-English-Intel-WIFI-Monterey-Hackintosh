# Customized OpenCore 0.8.0 EFI for ThinkPad T450s T450 X1C3 X250
Modified to work better with Mac OS Monterey. 

This EFI was based on CLAY-BIOS's excellent work, found here: https://github.com/CLAY-BIOS/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T450s-Hackintosh-OpenCore/blob/master/README-English.md and was modified to work with Mac OS Monterey. 

What works: Everything besides VGA. Touchscreen support on 3rd gen X1 Carbon. SD-card slot also works without any issue.

What’s been changed:

1. Default language changed from Chinese to English, mainly noticeable when performing fresh install.
2. Intel WIFI works as it should, Location Services works. Added multiple AirportItlwm.kext drivers for: Catalina, Big Sur, and Monterey (Monterey AirportItlwm.kext is enabled by default). Can be found at: Kernel > Add > 16 + 17 + 18 . Alternatively use itlwm.kext instead by enabling 19 (and disabling all other AirportItlwm.kext that comes before it.
3. Under NVRAM > Delete > 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82, prev-lang:kbd was added to make sure that English Language is detected and selected by default.
4. ThinkPad Assistant not included. All of the function keys for T450/s and X1 Carbon work perfectly as it is, and I wanted to reduce clutter. Other files such as Lenovo Wallpapers and DW1820a driver are also not included.
5. Added support for Android USB tethering, so that you can now tether your cellphone to the hackintosh (with USB), and enjoy faster speeds. The HoRNDIS driver that was added is supported by Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, and most likely older Mac OS. This kext does not interfere with any of the other kexts, and works perfectly.
This EFI has only been tested with Monterey and Catalina, but should work fine with Big Sur.

Good Luck!

## Introduction

- This repository was originally created for ThinkPad T450s. The default network card is DW1820A, and some other models have been supported through subsequent updates.
- Sound card default Layout-id = 32, if you hear noise upon connecting headphones, use the sound card repair script (ALCPlugFix), found in this repository.
- If you want to use the audio interface on the Docking, set the layout-id of the sound card to 55 and select the line output.
- Touchscreen support (With multi-touch and touchscreen gestures).
- Monterey support.
- Big Sur support.
- Catalina support.
- Mojave support.
- Docking support.
- Sidecar support (Turning on sidecar will cause the system to freeze randomly, Sidecar is disabled by default).
- This EFI (and other applications) works for all ThinkPads using 5th generation CPUs (Broadwell). Confirmed supported models are shown below.
- support ThinkPad X250, T450, T450s, X1 Carbon 3rd.
- Note: The 4th generation CPU (Haswell) is not supported. ThinkPad has never officially launched the 4th generation CPU (Haswell) T450, T450s, X250, X1C3, which are essentially T440, T440s, X240, X1C2.

## Hardware information
```  
- CPU：Intel Core i7-5600U i7-5600U i7-5500u i5-5300U i5-5200U

<summary><strong>Known issues ⚠️</strong></summary>
</br>

1. An external 4K monitor needs to unlock the advanced BIOS options to modify the DVMT, but this is difficult to implement and requires a simple method.
2. Due to DVMT limitation, the maximum resolution is only 2K-60hz. If your screen resolution exceeds 2K-60hz, the screen will be black.
3. When you sleep with Wi-Fi turned off, Wi-Fi cannot be turned on, and you need to sleep again to turn it on.
4. The docking graphics interface has no audio output.
5. Turning on sidecar will cause the system to freeze randomly.
6. the ThinkPad X1 carbon 3rd docking station cannot use the Ethernet interface because there is no corresponding driver support in the MacOS.
7. In MacOS Monterey, the Airdrop can only receive but not send.
8. There are some problems with Bluetooth in MacOS Monterey, and there is no solution at present.

</details>

<details>  
<summary><strong>About Bluetooth</strong></summary>
</br>

- 1.Because Apple modified the Bluetooth stack in MacOS Monterey, Bluetooth cannot be used normally in MacOS Monterey.
- 2.In MacOS Monterey, use brcmbluetoothinjector.kext + BlueToolFixup.Kext to drive brcm Bluetooth.
- 3.In MacOS Monterey, use IntelBluetoothfirmware.kext + BlueToolFixup. Kext to drive Intel Bluetooth.
- 4.Even if Bluetooth is driven in MacOS Monterey, only some functions can be used.

<details>  
<summary><strong>Docking</strong></summary>
</br>

- Note⚠️: the ThinkPad X1 carbon 3rd docking(DU9026S1) station cannot use the Ethernet interface because there is no corresponding driver support in the MacOS.
- ThinkPad X250 ThinkPad T450 ThinkPad T450s docking(40A1、40A2) station can be used normally.
- Use of docking can cause sleep problems, the solution is to add SSDT-IGBE patch to config.plist->ACPI.
- Flap mode cannot be used with SSDT-IGBE patch.
- Up to three displays (including the built-in display)
